# Pulse Oximeter Using MAX30100 and STM32F10x : Communication_I2C_STM32
This project involves creating a pulse oximeter system using the MAX30100 sensor interfaced with an STM32F10x microcontroller. The system measures heart rate and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) and displays these vital parameters in real-time via USART communication.
## Features
- Measurement of Heart Rate and SpO2.
- Real-time data output through USART.
- Uses I2C communication to interface with the MAX30100 sensor.
- System ticks integration for time management.
## Hardware Requirements
- STM32F10x Microcontroller
- MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter Sensor
- General Purpose PCB or Breadboard
- Connecting Wires
- USB to TTL Converter or similar USART interface
## Hardware Components Used
